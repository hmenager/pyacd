ID showseq-ex2
UC The standard list of output formats are only a small selection of the
UC possible ways in which a sequence might be displayed.  Precise control
UC over the output format is acheived by selecting the qualifier '-format 0' 
UC (Option 0 in the list of things to display).  For example,
UC by choosing format '0' and then specifying that we want to display the
UC things: 'b,s,t,c', we will output the sequence in the following way:
AP showseq
CL tembl:x13776 -sbeg 1 -send 120
IN 0
IN b,s,t,c

FI stderr
