ID seqret-ex10
UC Read all entries in the database 'tembl' that start with 'ab'
UC and write them to a file.
UC In this example the specification is all done in the command line
UC and to stop Unix getting confused by the '*' character,
UC it has to have a backslash ('\') before it:
AP seqret
CL "tembl:ab*"  aball.seq
FI stderr
FC = 1
FP 0 /Warning: /
FP 0 /Error: /
FP 0 /Died: /
FI aball.seq
FP /^>AB000095/
FP 5 /^>/
