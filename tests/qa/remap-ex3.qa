ID remap-ex3
UC This is an example where all enzymes in the REBASE database are used
UC but the -limit qualifier is not set so that all of the enzymes are
UC displayed and not just only the prototypes of the isoschizomers.
UC This is run with a small test version of the restriction enzyme database
UC and so you will probably see more enzymes when you run this.
