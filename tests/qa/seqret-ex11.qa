ID seqret-ex11
UC seqret does not read in features by default because this results in
UC slightly faster performance.  If however you wish to read in features
UC with your sequence and write them out on output, using '-feature' will
UC change the default behaviour to use any features present in the sequence. 
UC N.B. use embl format for the output file as the default format 'fasta'
UC reports the features in gff (file "<seqname>.gff")
